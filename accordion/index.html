              The event loop is a mechanism in JavaScript that handles
              asynchronous operations. It continuously checks the call stack and
              the task queue. When the call stack is empty, it picks the first
              callback from the queue and pushes it onto the call stack, which
              effectively runs the callback. This process continues as long as
              there are callbacks in the queue.

            <p class="answer display-none">
              Promises are objects in JavaScript that represent the eventual
              completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its
              resulting value. They provide a cleaner alternative to callbacks
              for handling asynchronous operations. A promise can be in one of
              three states: pending (initial state), fulfilled (operation
              completed successfully), or rejected (operation failed).

            <p class="answer display-none">
              Prototypal inheritance is a way of implementing inheritance in
              JavaScript. Every JavaScript object has a prototype property,
              which makes inheritance possible in JavaScript. When a property is
              accessed on an object and if the property is not found, JavaScript
              will look at the object's prototype, and then the prototype's
              prototype, until it finds the property or reaches the end of the
              prototype chain (null).

            <p class="answer display-none">
              undefined is a primitive value that is automatically assigned to
              variables that have been declared but have not been assigned a
              value. It also represents the return value of functions that do
              not explicitly return anything. null is a primitive value that
              represents the intentional absence of any object value. It is
              often used to represent that a variable has been explicitly set to
              no value or that a function intentionally returns no valid object.

On the margins of a conference on strengthening economic links between the United States and India, Yellen spoke with the news agency Reuters \u201cAs long as India doesn\u2019t use these Western services and instead finds other ones, they are free to buy oil at whatever price they choose. Any way is acceptable.\u201d Since the EU first suggested an embargo on Russian oil in May as retaliation for Moscow\u2019s invasion of Ukraine, the US has been pushing the idea of a cap. By denying Western allies insurance, maritime services, and financing for tanker cargoes priced above a set dollar-per-barrel cap, it aims to decrease Russia\u2019s oil revenues while keeping Russian crude on the market. With the cap in place, India, China, and other significant consumers of Russian crude oil would have the power to negotiate a lower price with Moscow. \u201cRussian oil is going to be selling at deep discounts, and we\u2019re pleased to see India, Africa, or China obtain that discount,\u201d says Yellen. It\u2019s okay,\u201d \u201cWhen the EU stops purchasing Russian oil, Russia will find it very difficult to continue delivering as much oil as they have done\u2026 They\u2019ll be actively looking for purchasers. Additionally, a lot of consumers depend on Western services. Added the Treasury Secretary \u201cWe have informed the nations that we do not believe the price cap mechanism would be followed. We think that most nations are peaceful.",

At the G20 conference in Bali on Wednesday, British Prime Minister Rishi Sunak will declare a new \u201crelationship\u201d with India, according to Downing Street. The U.K. will yearly offer 3,000 degree-holding Indians in the 18 to 30 age range jobs in the U.K. for up to two years under the U.K.-India Young Professionals Scheme. Beginning in early 2023, the program will operate on a sharing basis. In a statement, Mr. Sunak said, \u201cI know first-hand the enormous value of the strong cultural and historic links we have with India. I am happy that even more of India\u2019s most talented young people will now have the chance to experience everything that living in the U.K. has to offer, and vice versa\u2014making our society and economies richer, he added. UK President Sunak had mentioned conducting a bilateral exchange with India during his prime ministerial campaign in the summer. According to a news release from Downing Street, \u201cthe U.K. has more linkages with India than just about any nation in the Indo-Pacific region,\u201d with Indians making up nearly a quarter of all overseas students there and Indian investment in the U.K. generating 95,000 employment there. The U.K. government described the program\u2019s debut as an \u201cimportant milestone\u201d for both the U.K.\u2019s ties to the Indo-Pacific region and its relationship with India. According to Mr. Sunak, the Indo-Pacific region \u201cteems with active and quickly expanding economies.\u201d Suella Braverman, the British Home Secretary, claimed that Indians were the biggest group of visa overstayers in Britain in her remarks, which made it less likely that the countries would reach a trade agreement before the Deepavali deadline. The May 2021 MoU on the movement and migration partnership, which addresses sending visa overstayers back to their home countries, was cited in a Downing Street statement as saying, \u201cIn parallel to the transportation collaboration with India, we are also bolstering our capability to return immigration offenders.\u201d",

        "text": "India\u2019s G20 presidency will boost India\u2019s position as a country that can assist settle conflicts, navigate the projected global recession, and make growth and progress at an optimum level. The Group of 20\u2019s 17th summit, which brought together developed industrial economies and growing countries from the developing world, came to an end in Indonesia amid tensions between major powers, geopolitical unrest in the world order, an ongoing war in Europe, a food and energy crisis, a global economic downturn, and a pandemic that is still present in some regions of the world. The G20 was established in 1997, around two years after the Asian financial crisis, to address the problem in the world\u2019s political economy. It is now about a 23 year old group. Following the worldwide recession of 2008, the G20 summit of senior leaders was raised, and ever since, the importance of this group of countries has grown. The Group of 20 was created as a result of the Group of Seven wealthiest countries in the world, six of which are Western nations, failing to end the international economic crisis on their own. With their quicker rates of growth and enormous potential for development, emerging economies were seen as playing a crucial role in resolving any global economic issue. The G20 is an informal alliance of countries without a secretariat or permanent headquarters. It doesn\u2019t operate like a global organization. But there is no disputing its significance, and everyone recognizes its usefulness in the current global system. The G20, however, is not intended to address security challenges. Ironically, three security-related crises that have had a significant influence on the world economy coincided with the 2022 G20 summit being held in Indonesia. One is the invasion of Ukraine by Russia, which sparked hostilities between Russia and the Western countries, headed by the United States, and Russia, which lacks active allies. Many nations oppose the economic war the United States is waging against Russia through sanctions, but they also do not speak out against the substantial military assistance the West is providing to Ukraine. Everyone can see the effects of this war\u2019s economic effects, including the supply chain interruptions practically everywhere, the energy crisis in Europe, the food crisis in Africa, and many more. Of course, the conflict between humans and the coronavirus is the second conflict that has significantly impacted the world economy and comes before the conflict in Ukraine. Cambodian Prime Minister Hun Sen tested positive and left the G20 summit, demonstrating the Covid-19 pandemic\u2019s continuing symbolic impact. The 17th G20 summit\u2019s principal goal was economic \u201crecovery\u201d from the Covid-19-related issues that were affecting trade, investment, employment, human mobility, education, agriculture, industry, and other sectors. The third security trend that has had an effect on the world economy is the US-China cold war, which makes it challenging for many nations in the Indo-Pacific and other regions to take a side. The Trump Administration\u2019s tariff war was the catalyst for the entire situation, which reached a very high degree of tension when Nancy Pelosi, the speaker of the US House of Representatives, visited Taiwan despite repeated Chinese warnings against the trip. Joko Widodo, the president of Indonesia, made an appeal for cooperation and urged group efforts to promote political stability and global economic recovery at the G20 summit. Shaking hands and making a commitment to keep their differences from escalating into violence, President Joe Biden and Chinese President Xi Jinping. In an apparent effort to patch things up, President Xi Jinping went out to US allies including Australia and Japan. President Xi and Prime Minister Narendra Modi also shook hands and said hello. All of these actions won\u2019t immediately solve the problems plaguing the world\u2019s political economy or geopolitical conflicts. However, they produced uplifting vibes. But the Ukraine War was the main point of concern amongst the G20 leaders. The leadership of Indonesia came under a lot of pressure to decline the invitation for Russian President Vladimir Putin. Putin stayed away from the conference and dispatched his foreign minister to Bali to stand in for him while Jakarta declined to do so. Then, numerous Western leaders present at the Bali meeting immediately denounced the Russian military operation. A consensus-based proclamation, however, appeared challenging because so many other member nations had divergent viewpoints. Herein lies the prime minister of India\u2019s outstanding contribution. His speech at the summit emphasized the suffering of the underprivileged due to food and fertilizer shortages, the necessity of removing trade barriers in energy so that the international community can \u201crecover\u201d from the protracted economic downturn, the importance of discussion and statesmanship to settle disputes and establish peace, and most importantly, it demonstrated how much progress has been made in recent years. It is commendable that India contributed to the finalization of the G-20 leaders\u2019 draft declaration. After about two weeks, India will take over the G20 presidency, but Prime Minister Modi has already stepped into the role of a world statesman by meeting with the leaders of states and governments in Bali and seemingly persuading them that his concepts of peace and stability can result in a more favorable world where conflicts can only be resolved through diplomacy and prosperity can only be preserved through making it inclusive. Presidents Joe Biden and Xi Jinping, who represent \u201chard power,\u201d offered their support and stressed their desire to avoid starting a cold war at Bali. However, Prime Minister Modi showed the potential of \u201csoft power\u201d to advance friendly communication and put out strategies to achieve \u201cinclusive growth and prosperity\u201d both within and between nations. India\u2019s soft power has historically allowed it to take the lead in organizations like the Group of 77 of the Global South and the Non-Aligned Movement, which includes more than a hundred nations. India is now a significant player in the Group of 20 nations, which account for 60% of the world\u2019s population, 75% of global trade, and 80% of its GDP, thanks to its soft power once more. India\u2019s role in the international system as a nation that can aid in the resolution of disputes, steer the world economy through the anticipated recession, and ensure that growth and development are as inclusive as possible would be further strengthened by its G20 leadership.",

North Korea launched an intercontinental ballistic missile that landed near Japanese waters on Friday, its second significant weapons test this month, demonstrating the possible ability to launch nuclear strikes on the whole US mainland. While it is unclear whether North Korea has operational nuclear-armed missiles, some experts believe Friday\u2019s launch involves the country\u2019s longest-range missile, which is still in development and is meant to carry multiple nuclear warheads in order to defeat U.S. missile defense systems. North Korea\u2019s current barrage of weapons tests is intended to advance the country\u2019s nuclear arsenal and gain larger concessions in future diplomacy. It comes as China and Russia oppose US efforts to toughen United Nations sanctions aimed at halting North Korea\u2019s nuclear programme. The US promptly condemned the launch and threatened to take \u201call necessary steps\u201d to ensure the safety of its territory as well as that of its allies South Korea and Japan. Vice President Kamala Harris met with the leaders of those countries, as well as those of Australia, Canada, and New Zealand, who are in Bangkok for a regional summit to discuss the launch. \u201cWe once again urge North Korea to refrain from any illegal and disruptive actions.\u201d \u201cI reaffirm the United States\u2019 unwavering commitment to our Indo-Pacific allies,\u201d Harris stated at the start of the summit. \u201cThe countries represented here will continue to urge North Korea to engage in serious and long-term diplomacy.\u201d The Joint Chiefs of Staff of South Korea said the ICBM launch from North Korea\u2019s capital region was detected around 10:15 a.m. It appeared to fly on a high trajectory and land west of Japan\u2019s Hokkaido island.",

        "text": "Abu Dhabi Space is going to schedule a debate in UAE to advance dialogue on the global space economy. UAE said that India is a key \u2018vibrant\u2019 voice. The Abu Dhabi Space Debate (ASDS), slated for December 5-6 in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) capital, aims to further the conversation on global space economy, and India is one of the important \u201cvibrant\u201d voices in the discussion, according to a top Emirati official. The UAE government will host the two-day global event, which will provide a forum for world leaders and policymakers. Prime Minister Narendra Modi will virtually address the meeting on its first day. \u201cADSD aims to advance not only global dialogue and collaboration among nations, but also to forge concrete alliances, multilateral agreements, and provide a platform to advance the sector as a whole,\u201d says the organization. The UAE National Space Fund of AED 3 billion (about $820 million) was established in July of this year to foster cooperation between Emirati firms and foreign commercial players, thereby boosting the country\u2019s space sector. The ADSD is the latest in a series of actions made by the UAE as part of its targeted approach to the space sector. According to Emirati officials, the discussion will focus on how to use the space sector to stimulate entrepreneurship, encourage R&D capabilities, balance private sector objectives with a fair and equitable space economy, and increase diversity in high-tech companies. According to Emirati officials, the UAE\u2019s booming space industry gives opportunities for innovators and companies from all over the world, including India. \u201cTraditionally, the Emirati and Indian business sectors have been not only linked but interconnected, and there is no reason to imagine space being any different,\u201d said Ibrahim Al-Qasim, Deputy Director General, UAE Space Agency, in answer to media inquiries. The UAE Space Agency and the Indian Space Research Organisation (ISRO) have a friendly relationship, and there is still room for more agency-to-agency discussion, according to Al-Qasim, who also stated that the UAE wishes to share a \u201cbroader message\u201d with the Indian commercial actors. According to the UAE, the globe is entering a \u201cnew space age.\u201d According to Al-Qasim, the word refers to the growing number of countries throughout the world that not only \u201csaw an economic opportunity in space, but also the creation of a global commercial space sector.\u201d In the 1950s, the global space sector was dominated by only two main players: the United States and the former Soviet Union. Today, nearly 70 countries are exploring space. With the global space industry expected to generate $1 trillion in sales by 2040, there is rising hope that the space economy will drive industrial growth and innovation across a variety of industries, as well as provide economic possibilities for an ever-increasing number of people.",

        "text": "The FIFA World Cup in Qatar started with a controversy. As Iran players remained silent instead of singing their national anthem to support women protestors. Before the team\u2019s inaugural World Cup game against England, the players gathered together \u2013 in silence \u2014 while the national song of Iran played inside the Khalifa Stadium. While some stared blankly up into the skies, some looked down at the ground. One word of \u201cSorude Melliye Jomhuriye Eslamiye Iran\u201d was not spoken by any of them. The entire team\u2019s silence during that moment served as the most movingly eloquent declaration of their support for the demonstrations against the oppressive regime being organized by women back home. Many Iranian supporters also chose not to sing the national anthem. Some people booed, while others booed those who booed, reflecting the rift in the country. Others raised signs with the inscriptions \u201cFreedom for Iran,\u201d \u201cFreedom for women,\u201d \u201cWomen. Life. Freedom\u201d and \u201cIt\u2019s not Iran\u2019s national team, it\u2019s the Islamic Republic\u2019s squad\u201d in the colors of the Iranian flag. Such was the atmosphere that, according to reports, Iranian national television interrupted the live broadcast and only resumed it for England\u2019s \u201cGod Save The Queen.\u201d In fact, the main story surrounding the Iranian team even before the World Cup began centered on whether the players would protest. This question would undoubtedly be asked of every Iranian player or coach who appeared for a media interview. Carlos Quieroz, the head coach, said he was okay with players holding a protest. Ehsan Hajsafi, a lawyer, also expressed condolences for individuals who had passed away during the demonstrations, which intensified after Mahsa Amini, 22, who had been detained on suspicion of \u201cbreaching the clothing code\u201d for women, died while in detention on September 13. The news that Iran\u2019s police had detained two well-known actors who had shown support for the protest movement and taken off their headscarves in public added to the rage that they felt on Monday morning.",

        "text": "The bilateral trade between India & UAE was 5.9 lakh crore in the last fiscal which is going to cross 7.2 lakh crore this year. External Affairs Ministers of both countries met on Tuesday. The United Arab Emirates (UAE) will surpass USD 88 billion in bilateral trade with India this year, surpassing the United States and China as India\u2019s two largest economic partners. According to a report, the two countries\u2019 anticipated bilateral trade of 88 billion dollars for the current fiscal year will surpass the 73 billion dollar total for the previous fiscal year. Since 2014, when Prime Minister Narendra Modi led the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party to victory, the relations between India and the UAE have noticed a number of changes. The UAE has progressively risen through the ranks to become the nation\u2019s third-largest trading partner. The bilateral trade between India and the West Asian nation was valued at USD 36.82 billion over the course of five months, from April to August of the current fiscal year (CFY). When compared to the previous fiscal year, the trade is expected to exceed USD 88 billion in CFY. In the eight years that the BJP has been in power at the Center, Prime Minister Narendra Modi has traveled to the UAE four times, and the Foreign Ministers have met four times in the past three months. On June 28, during his visit to the UAE, Modi met with Sheikh Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan. India\u2019s EAM S. Jaishankar traveled to the UAE in August and September to co-chair the third Strategic Dialogue and the 14th Joint Commission Meeting with UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah. In February of this year, the UAE and India inked their first-ever Comprehensive Economic Partnership Agreement (CEPA). It went into effect in May 2022 and was the first for India in the previous ten years. Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahyan, the foreign minister of the United Arab Emirates, is currently traveling India on a two-day official tour to improve ties between the two nations. The UAE\u2019s foreign minister met with India\u2019s external affairs minister, S. Jaishankar, on Tuesday to talk about measures to improve their bilateral ties. Both nations are debating using UPI as a platform for payments for the 3.5 million-strong Indian population living in the UAE.",

        "text": "Saudi coastal city Jeddah got affected by the heavy rains & storm. As a result 24 flights were delayed, 2 people died, schools shut & many roads are blocked. Heavy rains struck western Saudi Arabia on Thursday, along with the seaside city of Jeddah, causing flights to be delayed and forcing the closure of schools. At least two people have already died, according to officials. The Mecca regional government issued a call for everyone to stay indoors unless absolutely necessary after two fatalities were reported so far. The Mecca region includes Mecca city as well as Jeddah, the second-largest city in the kingdom with a population of about four million. As soon as it started to rain on Thursday, the two-way road that many pilgrims use to travel to Mecca was shut down, according to state media. However, authorities said it was later reopened. The state-affiliated Al-Ekhbariya television aired footage of worshippers revolving about the Kaaba, the cube-shaped edifice that serves as the center of Islam, at the Grand Mosque in Mecca while it was pouring outside. Images shared on social media from Jeddah showed traffic snarled by standing water and some vehicles half submerged. The departure of several aircraft has been delayed owing to weather, according to the city\u2019s King Abdulaziz International Airport, which asked travelers to call companies for the most recent schedules. Before daybreak, the official Saudi Press Agency announced that municipal schools will be temporarily closed due to the expected persistence of the rain. To ensure the safety of both male and female pupils, schools were also canceled in the neighboring towns of Rabigh and Khulais, according to SPA. Final examinations are currently taking place in the kingdom, although all schools were already closed on Wednesday as a result of King Salman\u2019s proclamation of a holiday in the wake of Saudi Arabia\u2019s shocking World Cup victory against Argentina. In Jeddah, where locals have long complained about deficient infrastructure, winter rainstorms as well as flooding happen practically every year. In the city, floods claimed the lives of 123 people in 2009 and another 10 two years later.",

        "text": "There was a time when most of the international trades depended on the dollar currency. But now India & UAE are considering their own currencies for bilateral trading. According to Sunjay Sudhir, the Indian ambassador to the UAE, India and the UAE are in discussions for a bilateral trade deal valued in rupees and dirhams. According to news agency PTI, the central banks of India and the UAE are debating a concept paper on fostering bilateral trade in the national currencies of both nations in an effort to lower transaction costs. According to Sudhir, India released the concept paper for trading in local currencies. Both nations see the value in this. India and the UAE have exchanged concept papers. The central banks of the two nations are in conversation. Reduced transaction costs are the goal, according to Sudhir in New Delhi. He also stated that the standard operating guidelines and modalities will be discussed by the central banks of both nations. In order to strengthen their bilateral trade and economic connections, the UAE and India inked a free trade agreement (FTA) in February. Bilateral commerce is anticipated to rise from the current $60 billion to $100 billion in the following five years as a result of the free trade agreement. In 2020\u201321, the value of bilateral trade between the both countries India and the UAE was $43.3 billion. In 2020\u201321, total imports totaled $26.7 billion while exports were worth $16.7 billion. In 2019\u201320, $59.11 billion in two-way trade was reported, according to the media. It is commonly assumed that if the system works as intended, it might eventually play a significant role in the internationalization of the Indian rupee. If a currency is widely used as a means of trade around the globe, it is referred to as \u201cinternational.\u201d Early in July, SBI Research published a research claiming that trade in commodities such as oil and other raw materials in currencies including the Renminbi, Hong Kong Dollar, and Arab Emirates Dirham had increased significantly.",

        "text": "Samsung is building a folding screen laptop along with a virtual keyboard & touchscreen. However Lenovo & Asus have already launched foldable laptops in the market. Samsung has been developing foldable electronics for a while; the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4 has received much praise for being an excellent product that isn\u2019t diminished by folding technology. Based on recently filed patents, the Korean firm is now developing a foldable laptop. It won\u2019t be the first product of its type to hit the market when the next folding laptop debuts. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold from Lenovo sports a foldable display. In a similar vein, the newest ASUS Zenbook 17 Fold OLED features the largest folding screen currently offered on the market. The patent application for the same thing was made back in 2020. The Samsung folding laptop will enable users to fold it in half, reducing its size and the amount of storage space needed, in accordance with the patent that has been filed. This laptop might have a high refresh rate and an OLED panel (like most folding devices). Other folding laptops do include virtual keyboards, but Samsung\u2019s model will also include a virtual trackpad, indicating that the laptop will include a touch screen. According to the laptop\u2019s blueprints, it will have two USB Type C connections and be rather slim when opened. These connectors might provide functionality for data transfer and charging. At the top of the display, the laptop is anticipated to contain a conventional selfie camera. Windows 11 may be used by the Samsung folding laptop, which also has a folding hinge similar to the Samsung Galaxy Z Fold 4. Foldable laptops are nothing new in this context. The Lenovo ThinkPad X1 Fold was one of the first notable laptops featuring a folding display. The recently announced ASUS Zenbook 17 Fold OLED is one of the biggest laptops with a folding screen. The patent application was submitted to the United States Design Patent Office in 2020.",

        "text": "The World Bank has predicted that Indian expats will send a record \u20b9812,218 crore ($100 billion) to their homes in 2022. It is the first time that a single country is doing so. India is probably going to continue to be the country that receives the most remittances from overseas employees in 2022 as well. Remittances to India are predicted to increase by 12% to a staggering $100 billion in 2022, making up the majority of the $163 billion in payments made to all South Asian countries that year, based on a World Bank analysis released on Wednesday. According to the World Bank, any single country will receive $100 billion for the first time ever. Globally speaking, the growth of remittances to low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) this year was only 5%, as opposed to a 10.2% increase in 2021. These payments are a crucial source of income for households in low- and middle-income nations. According to the World Bank, they reduce poverty, enhance nutritional outcomes, are linked to greater birth weight and school enrolment rates for kids in low-income homes. Wage increases and a robust labor market in the US and other OECD nations helped to increase remittances to India. Governments in the Gulf Cooperation Council destinations supported low inflation through direct assistance programmes that safeguarded migrant workers\u2019 capacity to remit. In the 2nd quarter of 2022, transferring $200 to the area cost, on average, 4.1% less than it did a year earlier. \u201cMigrants support their families via remittances while assisting in loosening up the tight labor markets in their host nations. Workers have been aided in navigating the financial and employment uncertainty brought on by the COVID-19 pandemic by inclusive social protection policies. According to Michal Rutkowski, Global Director for Social Protection and Jobs at the World Bank, such policies have an impact on the entire world through remittances and must be maintained. The reopening of host economies following Covid, inflation, the strength of the dollar, and a lack of foreign currency in some nations are some of the factors that had an impact on the flow of funds throughout the year. The World Bank also issued a warning that migration caused by the environment will harm livelihoods.",

The most recent proposal, which has been backed by three EU ambassadors, comes just days before Monday, when a European boycott on Russian crude oil transported by sea and a prohibition on shipping insurance for such shipments go into force. As the legal process was still ongoing, the diplomats also spoke on the condition of anonymity. In order to prevent a precipitous loss of Russian oil to the world as a result of the new Western sanctions, the USD 60 number would indicate a cap close to the current price of Russia\u2019s petroleum, which dropped this week below USD 60 per barrel. It is significantly less expensive than the global benchmark Brent, which closed Thursday\u2019s trade at roughly USD 87 per barrel, but it might be high enough for Russia to continue selling even if a cap is rejected. A new buyer\u2019s cartel, believed to include both formal and unofficial members, will emerge once the final number is known. The move to impose a price cap was spearheaded by Western partners in the Group of Seven industrial countries, who still need to agree to the amount. Despite export restrictions, sanctions, and the freeze of central bank assets that started with the February invasion, oil remains the Kremlin\u2019s primary source of financial support and has so far held the Russian economy afloat. Every day, Russia exports almost 5 million barrels of oil. Failure of the price cap poses significant dangers to the world\u2019s oil supplies. Global energy costs may soar if it fails or if Russia responds by halting oil exports. Putin has stated that he will not sell oil at a price cap and will take action against countries who do so. Consumers in the US and Europe may experience additional gasoline price increases, while citizens in poorer nations may experience higher levels of food insecurity as a result.",

        "text": "India & the United States performed a joint military exercise in Uttarakhand. China objected to it. But the US & India snubbed China & said, \u201cIt\u2019s none of China\u2019s business!\u201d The US has reaffirmed that it supports India in the face of China\u2019s opposition to joint military drills between the two countries in the border state of Uttarakhand. In a roundtable discussion with the media on Friday, Elizabeth Jones, the US Charge d\u2019 Affaires in India, said, \u201cI would take you to the comments from my Indian colleagues, that it\u2019s none of their (China\u2019s) business.\u201d Also Read: UN Calls On China To Respect Right To Peaceful Protests The Indian foreign ministry reacted angrily on Thursday after China claimed that the exercises in Auli, which are located about 100 km from the border, violate the spirit of two border agreements: \u201cIndia exercises with whomever it chooses to and we do not give veto to third countries on this issue.\u201d The combined training exercises had \u201cnothing to do with the 1993 and 1996 agreements,\u201d according to ministry spokesperson Arindam Bagchi. In response to inquiries regarding the matter, Mr Bagchi stated, \u201cSince these were brought by the Chinese side, let me emphasize that the Chinese side needs to reflect and think about its own breach of these agreements of 1993 and 1996.\u201d Yudh Abhyas, India\u2019s 18th joint military exercise with the US, is now taking place in Uttarakhand, about 100 kilometers from the Line of Actual Control. Inquiries on trade and a potential priority agreement for India were also directed at the interim US envoy. Since trade has increased by twofold to $157 billion over the past seven years, she claimed, \u201cNobody, in my opinion, thinks a trade agreement is necessary. That is not currently being discussed.\u201d Ms. Jones, the top American diplomat in India, also discussed communal rhetoric used during Indian election campaigns. When questioned about the campaign that borders on racial hatred, she responded that the US government \u201cwill continue to raise it.\u201d Also Read: China\u2019s top official is a big supporter of India \u201cThis is a constant topic of conversation among our Indian coworkers. One advantage of our consequential connection is that we can talk about a wide range of topics, including easy and difficult ones, those on which we agree and those on which we disagree \u201cShe spoke. The campaign in Gujarat, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi is from, has shifted toward statements made by his party, the BJP, that have a communal undertone. Amit Shah, the Union Home Minister, made the following comment regarding claims that Muslims were gaslighted during the 2002 riots: \u201cGujarat had no room for development due to the state of chaos. They attempted to engage in intergroup violence in 2002; as a lesson, we imprisoned them.\u201d",
